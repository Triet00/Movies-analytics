# Movie Analysis: Data Collection, NLP & Predictive Modeling

Complete movie analysis pipeline from data collection to predictive modeling, combining web scraping, advanced NLP techniques, and statistical modeling to understand narrative patterns and predict movie success metrics.

## 1. Project Overview

This project performs end-to-end movie analysis through:

•	Data Collection: Web scraping IMDb for movie data and box office information

•	NLP Analysis: BERT embeddings, topic modeling (LDA), and plot similarity

•	Feature Engineering: Creating predictive features from plot semantics

•	Regression Modeling: Multiple linear regression with log transformations for ROI prediction

### 1.1 Technologies Used:

•	Python 3.x

•	NLP: sentence-transformers, gensim, nltk, spacy

•	ML/Stats: scikit-learn, statsmodels, numpy, pandas

### 1.2 Dataset
Scraped data: imdb_scraped_data_with_box_office.xlsx - Fresh IMDb data including movie titles, ratings, votes, plots, budget, and box office figures.

Processed data: movies_with_nlp_features.csv - Original data enhanced with engineered NLP features for modeling.

## 2. Analysis Pipeline

Part 1: Data Collection
•	Web Scraping: Automated data collection from IMDb search results
•	Box Office Data: Individual movie page scraping for financial metrics
•	Data Handling: Smart navigation through IMDb's dynamic content and pagination

Part 2: NLP Feature Extraction
•	BERT Embeddings: 384-dimensional plot vectors using all-MiniLM-L6-v2
•	Topic Modeling: 6 narrative topics via LDA (Action, Crime, Family, Sci-Fi, Horror, Romance)
•	Similarity Metrics: Plot similarity to highest-ROI movies
•	Feature Engineering: Centroid distance, embedding complexity, topic probabilities

Part 3: Regression Modeling
•	Log Transformations: Applied to ROI, Budget, Votes, Opening Weekend earnings
•	Logit Transformation: For similarity scores bounded between 0 and 1
•	Multiple Linear Regression: 
•	log(ROI) ~ log(Budget) + Year + Rating + log(Votes) +            log(Opening_Weekend) + logit(Similarity_to_top_ROI) + Topic

## 3. Installation
1.	Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Triet00/Movies-analytics.git
cd movie-plot-analysis

2.	Install dependencies:
pip install selenium beautifulsoup4 webdriver-manager pandas openpyxl
pip install numpy sentence-transformers scikit-learn gensim nltk spacy statsmodels

3.	Download NLTK data:
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('punkt')

## 4. Usage
1.	Data Collection: Run the web scraping script to gather fresh IMDb data
   
2.	NLP Analysis: Execute feature extraction to generate embeddings and topics
   
3.	Regression Modeling: Run statistical modeling for ROI prediction
   
The complete pipeline:
•	Scrapes current movie data from IMDb with box office information

•	Generates BERT embeddings and discovers narrative topics

•	Creates engineered features from plot semantics

•	Fits multiple regression models with proper transformations

•	Outputs predictions and model summaries

## 5. Key Results
•	Fresh Data Collection: Automated scraping of current movie information and box office data

•	Topic Discovery: 6 distinct narrative categories automatically identified

•	Plot Similarity: Quantified similarity between movies based on semantic content

•	ROI Prediction: Multiple regression model incorporating both financial and narrative features

•	Feature Importance: Statistical significance of plot-based features in predicting success

Example Output
Movies similar to 'Terrifier 2':

Horror Movie A: 0.8234 similarity

Horror Movie B: 0.7891 similarity

Horror Movie C: 0.7654 similarity

Identified movie topics:

Topic 0 (Action/Adventure): car, chase, mission, hero...

Topic 4 (Horror): blood, murder, scary, death...
